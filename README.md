# ‚ú® MANZI David üïπÔ∏è

## About Me
Hey there üëã I‚Äôm David, a Rwandan tech enthusiast and computer science student with an insatiable curiosity for how things work. I‚Äôm all about clean, maintainable code and building systems that don‚Äôt just function‚Äîbut make sense, and most importantly, spark joy in every little moment along the way. Whether I‚Äôm refining logic, crafting seamless experiences, or unraveling the layers of a complex system, I approach each challenge with care, intention, and a deep desire to truly understand what lies beneath the surface. I‚Äôm also a lifelong lover of math‚Äîdrawn to its patterns, its logic, and the quiet elegance of well-formed solutions. From building full-stack web apps to lighthearted gaming, and from tinkering with AI to exploring automation, I‚Äôm on a mission to learn boldly, create purposefully, and always stay grounded in clarity. Let‚Äôs build something amazing. üöÄ
